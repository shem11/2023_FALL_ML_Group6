`pip3 install scikit-learn yellowbrick seaborn numpy matplotlib`


## Which K works the best
The best k-value was found to be k=4 through using our elbow graph.

## The best K accuracy
Our best K (k=4) has a distorion score of about 520 out of 3000 which is relatively low. Additionally, k=4 is generally where the elbow graph begins to flatten, meaning it is more likely to be optimal.


## Insert a confusion matrix for the best K
