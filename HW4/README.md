## Model Evaluation 

 

We implemented three different regression models: Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and Lasso Regression. Here are the cross-validation scores for each model along with the alpha values used for Ridge and Lasso Regression: 

 

### Linear Regression 

- Cross-validation score: 0.85 

 

### Ridge Regression 

- Cross-validation score: 0.87 

- Alpha value:  2.782559402207126 

 

### Lasso Regression 

- Cross-validation score: 0.89 

- Alpha value:  2.782559402207126 

 

## Model Performance Comparison 

 

Based on the cross-validation scores, the Lasso Regression model performed the best with a score of 0.89. It outperformed both Linear and Ridge Regression models, making it the preferred choice for this specific dataset and problem.
